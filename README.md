# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for AI Research Papers
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to help users navigate AI research papers more effectively. The application allows users to upload an AI research paper, ask questions, and retrieve context-aware answers from the paper's content. The goal is to facilitate a better understanding of complex AI literature through query-based retrieval and concise summary generation.

# Key Features
Paper Upload: Users can upload AI research papers in PDF format.
Query-Based Retrieval: Retrieve specific sections or paragraphs from the paper based on user queries.
Summary Generation: Generate concise summaries for key sections like abstract, methodology, and results.
Interactive Q&A: Get natural language answers to questions based on the content of the paper.
Citation Assistance: Receive citation suggestions for specific sections or ideas within the paper.
Multi-Paper Support (optional): Ability to handle multiple papers for more comprehensive insights.

# Tech Stack
Text Extraction: PyPDF2, PDFMiner, or Tesseract (if OCR is required).
Vectorization: Sentence Transformers (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
Vector Database: Pinecone, FAISS, or Weaviate.
LLM Integration: OpenAI GPT models or Hugging Face models.
Frontend: Streamlit, Flask, or FastAPI.
Deployment: Streamlit Cloud, Hugging Face Spaces, or AWS.

# How to Use
Upload a Paper: Select and upload an AI research paper in PDF format.
Ask a Question: Enter a question related to the paper in the text input box.
Get an Answer: The system will retrieve relevant sections and generate a concise answer based on the paper's content.

# Project Deliverables
RAG Application: Fully functional retrieval-augmented generation application.
Documentation: Clear instructions on data preparation, model training, and deployment.
Demo: Hosted demo for live testing (using platforms like Streamlit Cloud, Hugging Face Spaces, or Heroku).
Evaluation: Accuracy evaluation by comparing model-generated responses with the original content of the research paper.
